| Operating System | Arch Linux   | GPL         | Because of its simplicity and KISS ( keep it simple, stupid!)  philosophy. Arch linux has a rolling release model. It also has a large  and active community, which means there is a lot of support available if  you need it. |
| Shell            | Zsh          | GPL         | Supports a lot of plugins and has auto tab completion and syntax highlighting too. You can try my zsh configurations here                                                                                                      |

| File Manager     | lf           |             | A terminal based file manager just like ranger but its written in go so its a lot faster.It also has a lot of  great features like tabs, previewing of files and integration with other  cli tools.                            |
| Synchronization  | Syncthing    | MPV v2      | Useful for synching files over the same network.                                                                                                                                                                               |
