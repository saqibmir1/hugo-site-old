**Most people learn tools instead of leraning concepts first. As a consaquence, they often lack
the funcamental knowledge of how things actually work**

## Introduction
Like for example, many CS students use VS Code with mulitiple extensions for compiling
and running code, which i'm not saying is necessarily a bad thing but here is the issue;
most of these people don't even know how to manually compile their code manually or
use a terminal. This is because they heavily rely on these huge IDE's from day 1
without even bothering to look into how the language they've been using for month even
works.

## Now what to do
You should learn concepts before diving into a spicific tool. Let's say you are learning gpg (tool)
and you are watching some stupid video on how to encrypt a file using gnupg. You will be
able to encrypt your file by copy pasting the code but you wont be able to understand
what you are doing simply because you lack the basic understanding. If you knew how encryption
works, what are private, public keys (concepts), only then you will be able to understand
what you are doing.

Same goes for "Learning Linux". If you are a new user, dont start with learning a tool,
start by reading the DOCS, read the history of linux, how a decentrailized system works,
how it's different from windoze and macos. Then you can move towards learning a GNU tool.

### Read the effin docs
Reading docs should be the first thing you should do when learning a new skill.
Docs are made by the developers of the project so its one of the best resource out there.
Sadly, some people don't even know docs exist. I done seen niggas go to youtube toturials
instead of reading docs when learning a new tool or language. And if you are not able
to understand the docs, just know that you lack the fundamentals.


### Look at the source code
Explore free software, go to github, gitlab or any other platform and take a look at the naked code. Learn how a project is maintained. Look at PRs, issues etc. Just spend time on git. Trust me you can learn a lot by just looking at public repos.  I done seen niggas use an open source tool for years and not look at the source code even once. Breh, alteast know what language your software is written in.

### Compile program manually
Not all the time but sometimes. Compiling source code can be helpful in learning
        how packages work, what are its build dependencies etc. You can optimize and customize the software too by manual compilation. Just read the compilation instructions on the wiki/readme


### Try to stick with the minimalist software
Let me elaborate. Let's say you want to download a huge file using multiple connections (parallel downloading). 
        Instead of using some bloated propriotary software (1DM), you can just use a minamal cli tool like axel.
        Why? Because not only does axel do the same job but also is  minimal, open source and has a man page, so you can look at it
        and have a basic idea of how it works. Also minimal software = small documentation =
        easier comprehension.

## Conclusion
Priorityze conceptual learning over tools. Once you have concepts, learning tools is easy peasy.

**PS:** I'm black btw, i have the pass.
