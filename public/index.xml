      <description>Greetings, mortal!. I am an outrageous concoction of excessive self-conciousness and meloncholic tendencies, with a dash of quirkiness and a sprinkle of oddball charm. when i&amp;rsquo;m not busy staring at the wall and contemplating the futility of existence, you can usually find me binging on cat videos and tinkering with free and open source software.</description>

      <description>Most people learn tools instead of leraning concepts first. As a consaquence, they often lack the funcamental knowledge of how things actually work
Introduction Like for example, many CS students use VS Code with mulitiple extensions for compiling and running code, which i&amp;rsquo;m not saying is necessarily a bad thing but here is the issue; most of these people don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to manually compile their code manually or use a terminal.</description>

The linux community is vast, with numerous options (distros) to choose from, whichy leads to the paradox of choice. When faced with too many choices, new linux users tend to make either bad desicions or make fine desicions and feel disappointed about the results.</description>

      <description>PC Purpose Name Licence Description Operating System Arch Linux GPL Because of its simplicity and KISS ( keep it simple, stupid!) philosophy. Arch linux has a rolling release model. It also has a large and active community, which means there is a lot of support available if you need it. Shell Zsh GPL Supports a lot of plugins and has auto tab completion and syntax highlighting too. You can try my zsh configurations here Text Editor Neovim Apache v2 A terminal based vim like text editor with a little more features and plugins.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a to-the-point, no bullshit guide on why and how to install custom rom on any andorid device.
What is custom rom Andorid is an open source project and every andorid smartphone company uses their own skin/ui for their phones, for example redmi uses miui, samsung uses one ui and so on to make them look diffent from their competetors. These roms are calles stock roms.
So custom is is essentially a custom skin or custom ui built and maintained by developers voluntarily.</description>
